# Bullet Identifier - Gun Ammunition Classification System

**Bullet Identifier** is an AI-powered system designed to identify and classify gun ammunition types from images. By leveraging advanced object detection models, such as YOLO (You Only Look Once), this software can analyze images of bullets and casings to determine key characteristics, including caliber, markings, and manufacturing details.

## Features
- **Real-time Object Detection:** Quickly identify ammunition from uploaded images or live camera feeds.  
- **Detailed Classification:** Extract specific details, such as caliber size, factory markings, and type.  
- **Accuracy and Speed:** Powered by state-of-the-art YOLO models for high precision and performance.  
- **Customizable Dataset:** Easily adaptable to new ammunition types by adding more data.  
- **Intuitive Interface:** User-friendly web or mobile interface for non-technical users.

## Technology Stack
- **Machine Learning Framework:** YOLOv8 for object detection and classification.  
- **Dataset Management:** Roboflow for image labeling and preprocessing.  
- **Programming Languages:** Python for backend processing and training the model.  
- **Web/Mobile Integration:** Flask/Django for backend APIs, with React or Flutter for the frontend.

## How It Works
1. **Upload an Image:** Users upload an image of a bullet or casing.  
2. **Model Analysis:** The system processes the image using the trained YOLO model to detect and classify objects.  
3. **Result Display:** Key details, including ammunition type, caliber, and other specifications, are displayed.  
4. **History Tracking:** Save previous searches and results for future reference.
